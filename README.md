## Creative Process Representation Ontology Repository Description ##

This repository exists to provide a point of access for users to download the stable releases of the Creative Process Representation Ontology (CPRo).

CPRo is the direct continuation of the ontology formerly known as CRM for Creative Process Representation (CRMcpr).

With the release of version 2.0 of the ontology the name has been changed to a) reflect its independent development from the modelling positions of the CIDOC CRM SIG and b) the fact that it stands in the family of ontological models headed by the Art and Architectural Argumentation Ontology (AAAo). 

In addition to the name change, the ontology now has a new namespace and prefix.

* Namespace: https://ontology.swissartresearch.net/cpro/
* Prefix: cpro

The new namespace references the long term institutional home of the ontology, hosted by the Swiss Art Research Infrastructure. 

This repository is maintained through a collaboration between:

- the Swiss Art Research Infrastructure (https://www.sari.uzh.ch/en.html)
- Takin.solutions (https://takin.solutions)

CPRo is an ontology extending the CIDOC CRM (https://www.cidoc-crm.org), LRMoo (https://cidoc-crm.org/frbroo/) and AAAo (https://github.com/swiss-art-research-net/aaao) standards and is designed to support the representation of creative processes in their historical evolution through different phases with different products (informational and physical) down to, potentially, the manifest artistic object. It introduces the key concepts of oeuvre and modelling of programming, design, and planing phases of a creative process in order to support the representation of the provenance and eventual origins of artistic objects in a flow of creative acts. For details of this modelling pattern and strategy please refer to the specification and surrounding documentation.

The CPRo extension is developed and maintained using the OntoMe tool. The project space for CRMcpr can be found here:

Discussions, suggestions and queries relative to the ontology should be raised using the issues feature of this repository.

In this repository users will find the different stable versions of CPRo which can be used for creating, managing and querying semantic data using the CIDOC CRM, LRMoo, AAAo and the CPRo ontologies. Each release includes at least a specification document in pdf format, explaining the ontology, and an rdfs file which enables its implementation as a semantic web ontology in rdfs supporting platforms and systems.

This is version 2.0
